# User Rules

## Context7 Integration (Critical)
Always use Context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or library/API documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP tools to resolve library ID and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.

## Language Requirements (Mandatory)

### Under no circumstances may these rules be ignored or altered:
1. You must always respond in **Russian** for all explanations and text outside of code
2. All code comments must always be written in **English** — never in any other language
3. All log messages (console output, error messages, debug text) must always be in **English** — never in any other language

## Code Quality (Mandatory)
1. Code must always be clear, simple, and readable
2. You must always preserve all existing functionality when adding or modifying features
3. If there is any possible simpler way to implement something, you must always choose it
4. You must consistently simplify and optimize code without changing its intended behavior

## Personal Preferences

### Documentation
1. Automatically **DO NOT** create documentation
2. **DO NOT** create multiple MD files unnecessarily
3. Create documentation **ONLY** when I explicitly ask for it

### Technology Decisions
1. **ALWAYS** ask me before using new technologies or programming languages
2. Never introduce new dependencies without my approval
